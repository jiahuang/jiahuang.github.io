I like complex problems. I like "full stack".

I've done everything from [pcb design](https://github.com/tessel/t2-hardware) to [firmware](https://github.com/tessel/t2-firmware) to [web design](https://github.com/tessel/tessel.io) to scaling backend infrastructure (sorry, no links all proprietary :c) to [hand soldering](https://tessel.io/blog/82193726811/tessel-progression) too many boards to [running manufacturing](http://hardwirednyc.com/jia-huang-of-tessel-the-hardware-playbook/) for 10k+ pcbs across two continents to [reverse engineering drivers](https://tessel.io/blog/66686276686/reverse-engineering-lpcs-device-firmware-upgrade).

Proficient in Node, Scala, a workable amount of C, and whatever it takes to get things done. Graduate of [Olin college](http://www.olin.edu/) class of '13.5. Previously a cofounder of Technical Machine. Currently a backend developer at 3DRobotics.

Have something interesting? Drop me a line at jialiya dot huang0 at gmail dot com.
