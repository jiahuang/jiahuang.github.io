This was supposed to help me learn Golang. Instead it ended up being an emoji library. 5/5 would look at hundreds of emojis again.

<h4><a href="https://github.com/3drobotics/cloud-akka-request">Request lib for Akka</a></h4><span class="date post-meta">Oct, 2015</span>
My first Scala project. The Akka http library was too confusing so I made a wrapper. I didn't actually know Scala so it reads a lot like JS. It's now embedded in a lot of code at 3DRobotics. Whoops.

Wrote a JS driver for the APDS-9960 gesture sensor. It can detect 100% of hands that aren't there.

<h4><a href="http://olinjs.github.io/">Olin JS</a></h4><span class="date post-meta">Spring, 2013</span>

During the winter of 2012, a few friends I decided to teach a CS class at Olin College focused on being able to prototype and deliver products -- the type of class we always wished had been able to take. We were still students at Olin though, so we partnered up with a professor to issue the course credits. Wrote and got the curriculum approved, was in charge of grading, and gave several lectures. The semester long course started with a 4 week long crash course in Node, Mongo, and HTML/CSS. For the next 3 weeks, we brought in an external company each week to pitch a problem space that students worked on. The final half was reserved for a project. Each year the teaching staff changes due to them graduating. Somehow this is still a thing 3 years later. Weirdly enough, all the students I taught got 4 credit hours, but I got none for teaching :c

<h4><a href="http://github.com/jiahuang/d3timeline">d3 timeline</a></h4><span class="date post-meta">Dec, 2012</span>
<a href="http://github.com/jiahuang/d3timeline"><img style="margin-top:0px" src="/images/projects/d3-timeline.png"></a>
D3 didn't have a timeline library. I wrote one. Other people found it useful.

<h4><a href="http://github.com/jiahuang/avr-isp-shield">arduino shield</a></h4><span class="date post-meta">Dec, 2012</span>
<a href="https://github.com/jiahuang/avr-isp-shield"><img style="margin-top:0px" src="/images/projects/avr-isp-shield.png"></a>
Got tired of manually hooking up wires to an Arduino to program ATTinies. Made a shield for it.

<h4><a href="https://github.com/jiahuang/ant-farm">Ant</a></h4><span class="date post-meta">Nov, 2012</span>
<a href="https://github.com/jiahuang/ant-farm"><img style="margin-top:0px" src="/images/projects/ant.png"></a>
Ants are proximity detection devices running on ATTiny24s and nRF24L01+s. Designed the PCB, programmed, tested, and managed production pipeline for ~300 devices.

<h4><a href="https://github.com/jiahuang/zap">Zap</a></h4><span class="date post-meta">Sept, 2012</span>
<a href="https://github.com/jiahuang/zap"><img style="margin-top:0px" src="/images/projects/zap.png"></a>
Wanted a programmatic way to draw circuit diagrams using SVGs. It was hard and I realized I didn't like circuits.

<h4><a href="/files/mobius.pdf">Mobius gear</a></h4><span class="date post-meta">Dec, 2011</span>
<a href="/files/mobius.pdf"><img style="margin-top:0px" src="/images/projects/mobius.png"></a>
It's like a mobius strip, except it's got gears and can rotate while flipping inside-out. Worked for about 30 seconds.

<h4><a href="/files/reddit.pdf">reddit statistics</a></h4><span class="date post-meta">Oct, 2011</span>
<a href="/files/reddit.pdf"><img style="margin-top:0px" src="/images/projects/reddit.png"></a>
Collected data about the top 200 reddit posts every 15 min over the course of 2 weeks to try and determine what makes a post likely to hit the front page. Hint, it's voting rings. Voting rings and butts.
